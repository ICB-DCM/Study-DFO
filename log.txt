algorithms:
-----------

- freely available for academic usage + matlab (?)
- propreritary ones may be better, but not easily accessible for scientists
- better algorithms from RS study with exception of TOMLAB, which is proprietary

options:
--------
default parameters (applicants do not have the knowledge or cannot afford to try out many different algorithmic options)
local/global: difficult to do correctly
consider local runs as multistart, 1 start of global algorithm with same total maxFunEvals.
starts/maxFunEvals: 20/1000, 1/20000
* for multimodal problems: need to do at least as many starts as modes -> maybe global algorithm that balances local/global search himself (-> but must be good algorithm, so often a simple multistart is easier)


test problems:
--------------

globallib, princetonlib, luksan+vlcek
convex/non-convex, smooth/non-smooth

test set cannot be biased, as we are not interested in the share of solved problems for a particular algorithm, but in the comparison between different algorithms. therefore, different test sets will highlight different features, but a good optimizer should be able to solve them all.


evaluation criteria:
--------------------

optimal value known -> use that
alternative (esp. for noisy problems): run all, take best value found over all optimizers, consider that as optimum + eps.


notes:
------
TOMLAB: glbsolve, glcsolve, ego, rbfsolve: for box constraints
